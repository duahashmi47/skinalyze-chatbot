  {"prompt": "What causes dark circles under the eyes?", "response": "Dark circles can be a result of visible blood vessels just below the thin skin under the eyes or shadowing from sunken areas around the eyes caused by the breakdown of collagen and elastin as we age."},
  {"prompt": "What can worsen the appearance of dark under-eye circles?", "response": "Lack of sleep and UV damage caused by sun exposure can make under-eye circles look darker."},
  {"prompt": "What's the best way to care for dry skin in the winter?", "response": "To keep skin hydrated during the cold winter months, slather on a moisturiser that contains glycerin twice a day and take short, warm showers, as opposed to long, hot ones, which can strip skin of its natural moisture."},
  {"prompt": "How can I tell if I have dry skin?", "response": "If your skin is dry, you may experience a feeling of 'tightness', itching, rough, scaly or flaky skin or cracks in skin."},
  {"prompt": "Why have I developed dry skin when I have never had it before?", "response": "Dry skin can develop at any time. Common reasons include sun exposure, climate or temperature changes and indoor heating or air conditioning."},
  {"prompt": "Why do women struggle with the loss of skin elasticity more than men?", "response": "Women's skin naturally has less collagen than men's. As we age and experience menopause, lower estrogen levels cause a decrease in collagen production as well."},
  {"prompt": "What effect do free radicals have on the skin?", "response": "Free radicals can harm skin by damaging DNA, cell membranes and collagen. They are the cause of some of the signs of aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagging skin."},
  {"prompt": "What is collagen and why is it important?", "response": "Collagen is a skin protein responsible for the elasticity and resiliency of skin. As we age, collagen production slows resulting in wrinkles and other common signs of aging."},
  {"prompt": "What is the difference between a fine line and a wrinkle?", "response": "The difference is visibility. A fine line will almost always disappear when you are relaxed, whereas a wrinkle is always visible."},
  {"prompt": "What are the causes of fine lines and wrinkles?", "response": "As we age, collagen production slows and elastin (another protein found in skin) becomes less flexible, causing skin to be thinner and less elastic. Over time, skin slowly loses its ability to retain its shape and wrinkles begin to form."},
  {"prompt": "Are there foods that cause acne?", "response": "Some studies show no link between diet and acne, while others do. Dairy products and carbohydrate-rich foods in particular may trigger breakouts."},
  {"prompt": "Will my acne improve during the summer?", "response": "Depending on the individual, acne can get better or worse during the summer. If it does get worse, increased sweat production is the most likely culprit."},
  {"prompt": "I have acne. Can I still wear makeup?", "response": "Of course. It's fine to wear makeup if you have acne. Just be sure to choose noncomedogenic products that won't clog pores."},
  {"prompt": "Why is acne more common in teenagers?", "response": "The appearance of acne is closely linked to hormonal fluctuations that occur most frequently during puberty, which is why it is more common in teens."},
  {"prompt": "Is acne hereditary?", "response": "It can be. Studies show that you are more likely to have acne if you have a family history of it, particularly if one of your parents had acne."},
  {"prompt": "What is acne?", "response": "Acne is the result of skin inflammation, usually caused by overactive sebaceous (oil) glands."},
  {"prompt": "How do I know if my acne is severe?", "response": "Severe acne is more than just red pimples or inflamed, pus-filled lesions; it also causes painful cysts containing pus and can lead to permanent skin damage and scarring."},
  {"prompt": "What are the signs and symptoms of sensitive skin?", "response": "Sensitive skin frequently stings, burns or becomes irritated, inflamed or red."},
  {"prompt": "What causes sensitive skin?", "response": "Sensitive skin is often caused by a weakening of skin's natural moisture barrier and may be the result of genetics, aging, hormonal or environmental factors."},
  {"prompt": "How can I improve my sensitive skin?", "response": "Gentle, fragrance-free, noncomedogenic moisturisers hydrate skin and improve its moisture barrier. A strong barrier will block potential irritants from entering skin."},
  {"prompt": "What causes oily or shiny skin?", "response": "Oily or 'shiny' skin is often caused by overactive oil glands, that produce too much oil (also known as sebum). The activity of oil glands decreases as you age."},
  {"prompt": "Should I still moisturize if I have oily skin?", "response": "Definitely. It is important to use a light moisturiser even if you have oily skin, to keep skin healthy and counteract any dryness caused by washing your face. Allowing skin to become too dry will only exacerbate the problem by prompting skin to make even more oil."},
  {"prompt": "Why do pores get larger?", "response": "Pores can become enlarged due to a variety of reasons. Dirt may get in the pore, causing it to widen, or the pore may have less support as you age, which makes it larger."},
  {"prompt": "What is the difference between AHAs and BHAs?", "response": "AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) and BHAs (beta hydroxy acids) both work to exfoliate the top layer of dead skin cells. BHAs are often used in blemish or pore-minimizing products."},
  {"prompt": "How can I shrink my pores?", "response": "BHAs (beta hydroxy acids), such as salicylic acid, are an effective treatment for reducing the look of pore size by exfoliating the surface cells of the pore."},
  {"prompt": "Why does my skin look dull?", "response": "As dead skin cells build up, they cause light to scatter unevenly across skin, resulting in a duller-looking complexion."},
  {"prompt": "How can I have more radiant skin?", "response": "Skincare products containing AHAs (such as glycolic acid) or BHAs (such as salicylic acid) help exfoliate the top layer of dead skin cells to reveal more radiant skin underneath. Skin scrubs work similarly by mechanically removing the top layer of dead skin cells."},
  {"prompt": "What is combination skin?", "response": "Skin is considered combination when some areas are dry or normal and others are oily."},
  {"prompt": "Do self-tanners protect the skin from the sun's UV rays?", "response": "Self-tanners do not protect skin from damage caused by sun exposure unless they contain SPF protection, so it is important to still wear a moisturiser with broad spectrum SPF protection â€” even if you self-tan."},
  {"prompt": "What does the SPF number mean on sunscreen?", "response": "The SPF number â€” or sun protection factor â€” refers to the length of time you can spend in the sun without burning. That means, for example, if you wear an SPF 15 lotion, your skin should be protected from burning about 15 times longer than without any lotion. The exact length of time will vary by your skin tone & genetic makeup."},
  {"prompt": "Do I still need to wear sunscreen on cloudy days?", "response": "Yes, you should apply sunscreen on cloudy days, as some UV rays penetrate clouds."},
  {"prompt": "What are the differences between UVA and UVB rays?", "response": "UVA rays are present all year round and can penetrate glass. They are more abundant than UVB rays, and are a key cause of skin aging. There are more UVB rays in the summer, and these are the main cause of sunburn."},
  {"prompt": "What causes sunburn?", "response": "Sunburn develops when skin is exposed to more UV rays than it can protect itself against with natural melanin."},
  {"prompt": "When are the sun's rays the strongest?", "response": "The sun's rays are most intense from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and are strongest at high altitudes or when reflected off water, snow or sand."},
  {"prompt": "What is tanning?", "response": "Tanning is the result of increased melanin production, skin's natural pigment."},
  {"prompt": "What are the long-term effects of tanning?", "response": "Tanning is the primary cause of the look of aging, such as fine lines, wrinkles, sagging and dark spots. Long-term exposure will cause your skin to age more quickly, along with increasing the risk of developing skin cancer."},
  {"prompt": "How does air conditioning affect my skin?", "response": "Air conditioning can draw natural moisture from your skin, leaving it dry."},
  {"prompt": "What is the difference between a physical and a chemical exfoliant?", "response": "A physical exfoliant, such as a scrub, mechanically removes dead surface skin using beads, nut shells or another substance. Chemical exfoliants, such as glycolic acid, dissolve the bonds that adhere dead cells to skin's surface."},
  {"prompt": "How does stress effect my skin?", "response": "When you are stressed, your body releases cortisol, a hormone that can cause changes to oil glands. That's why breakouts often occur during stressful periods."},
  {"prompt": "How to Know Your Skin Type?", "response": "The most common skin types are dry, combination, and oily. Commonly, dry skin causes feelings of tightness around the eyes and mouth, as well as patches of flaky skin around the cheek area. Combination skin presents a shine on the nose and forehead and also includes dry patches on the cheek area. Whereas oily skin is generally soft and greasy to the touch and gives the cheeks an overly shiny surface."},
  {"prompt": "What is the best way to care for oily skin?", "response": "To care for oily skin, use a gentle cleanser, toner, and a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer. It is also important to use products that are non-comedogenic, meaning they won't clog pores."},

  {"prompt": "What is the best way to care for acne-prone skin?", "response": "To care for acne-prone skin, use a gentle cleanser, toner, and a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer. It is also important to use products that are non-comedogenic, meaning they won't clog pores."},

As a result, this allows the moisturiser to penetrate into the skin before SPF application. Also, SPF should always be the final step in your skincare routine as it is a thicker consistency, so it must not overshadow the thinner products."},

  {"prompt": "[Before&After] [B&A] [Selfie] - Cutting sugar changed my life", "response": "After stopping the birth control pill in the summer of 2023, my skin quickly developed what is known as adult acne. I went to a dermatologist for the first time in fall 2023 and asked for advice. They prescribed me the cream Dipalen, but my skin reacted to it as if I had a sunburn\u2014becoming very red and sensitive. When I followed up, I was told this reaction was normal.\n\nAfter several appointments with different dermatologists, they all told me the same thing: Dipalen was the only solution for my case, and it had helped many adults with hormonal acne. I was advised to use nothing else on my face except a cleanser\u2014no moisturizer or similar products, as those would supposedly worsen the acne.\n\nAfter using the cream for over a year without seeing good results, my dermatologist finally recommended cutting out sugar. Dipalen had to work, and if it didn\u2019t, my last option would be multiple sessions of acid peels. After researching what those peels actually do, I immediately knew I did not want to go that route.\n\nThe day after my appointment, I completely cut out sugar. I started learning about nutrition and began cooking and baking fresh meals myself. Within three months, my skin looked almost \u201cnormal\u201d again! Throughout this period, I also used a cleanser: Neostrata \u2013 Mandelic Clarifying Cleanser. Now that I no longer have inflamed breakouts, I\u2019ve added a moisturizer: No Cosmetics \u2013 All in One Barrier Cream. Even within the first few weeks of quitting sugar, I already noticed my skin improving. Additionally, I started supplementing with zinc.\n\nFor many people, my skin might not have seemed that bad or problematic, but as a 27-year-old working woman, it affected me mentally a lot.\n\nFor anyone out there struggling with skin issues, I highly recommend cutting out sugar\u2014it comes with so many other benefits for both body and mind. My skin is far from \u201cperfect,\u201d but I\u2019m still on my journey of lifestyle changes! :)"},

  {"prompt": "[Personal] I feel like good skin is almost entirely genetics", "response": "I have been told countless times how there are so many rules to clear skin, you must wash it, moisturise it, you shouldn\u2019t touch your face, you should have clean sheets, you should have clean diet etc. Over the years I have made a lot of adjustments in those areas but nothing seemed to have any effect on my skin. It just seems completely random to me. \n\nMy skin has never been terrible but it wasn\u2019t perfect either, just some pimples here and where, just your average teenager basically.

I was told \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t just wash your face with water and soap, you should use skincare !\u201d, well I did and I saw absolutely no difference.\n\nAnother example, for almost 5 months I had been bulking and eating a lot of unhealthy food, I was expecting to have bad skin during that time but no, I actually saw 0 difference. I though ok now when it\u2019s time to start the cut let\u2019s see if radically cleaning up my diet will improve it, I even washed my sheets so it doesn\u2019t effect anything. To my surprise there was an opposite effect. On my first week of my diet I had more break outs than in the past month. \n\nThe only thing that actually helped a ton was not picking my pimples, that was a life changer. Other than that I feel like this whole skincare obsession is weird. Of course if you have terrible acne you should consult with a dermatologist and they will give you actual medical treatment. But if you just have a couple of small pimples I think you should try having healthy habits, but no need to obsess over it since it\u2019s almost entirely genetics. \n\nWhat do you guys think ? I think I might get a lot of hate for this but I don\u2019t mean it in a negative way, that\u2019s just my personal experience and I decided to share it to see what other people think. "},

  {"prompt": "[Trigger Warning][Misc] This is how I looked the entire time of taking accutane", "response": "This is a post of support for all the people that are going through the same things I went through while taking accutane. \nUnfortunately at the ripe age of 21 I was struck with cystic acne due to genetics.

Then, one day, everything changed. \nAfter some failed attempts with retinoids and acids (azelaic, AHA, BHA, Salicylic, Benzoyl peroxide etc) my skin was getting all the worse and the cystic acne was truly on a sprint. Apart from the multiplying by the minute huge cysts I was also facing crazy inflamation with rosacea flare ups. No need to mention everything was super painful.\nThen, after a change of doctors and the necessary blood tests I went on accutane with the following timeline and dosage: alltogether 6 months 2 of which where with 20mg, 2 with 40mg and the 2 final with 60mg. The whole time I was on accutane i was SUFFERING. My lips on these pictures are nowhere near the worst phases I went through and that was nothing compared to my .. uhm.. anus. Unfortunately the same effect happened there, resulting in a permanent tear that even now, at 26 yo, sometimes reappears. My back and bones were killing me, I was severely constipated, my face was hurting SO much all the time, my nose and mouth were stripped of skin inside and out and everything was dryer in general. I'm lucky enough to be drinking shit tons of water everyday otherwise I simply don't know what could've happened...\nWould I change anything if I went back? Absolutely not. I was devastated when struck by acne, something I have never dealt with before, and was affecting me and my confidence at the time very deeply.

  {"prompt": "Why we've been treating Keratosis Pilaris (KP) wrong and how we can improve treatment options [Research][B&A]", "response": "This post is the culmination of over a decade of research, testing, and persistence in advancing KP treatments and our understanding of this condition. Like so many of you, I have met with countless dermatologists across the country and sunk significant money into trying to effectively treat this condition. I wholeheartedly believe that this theory and the treatments I have proposed are the most effective and up to date options for reducing the severity of Keratosis Pilaris.\u00a0\n\nKeratosis Pilaris is not caused by keratin buildup in the skin. Keratin buildup around the follicle is one of the last symptoms to develop in a series of cascading symptoms.\n\nHi everyone- my name is Devin Beaubien ([u/Poem\\_KP](https://www.reddit.com/user/Poem_KP/)) and I moderate the [r/keratosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/) subreddit.\u00a0\n\nI've been researching Keratosis Pilaris and trying to understand what the condition is, why I have it, and how I could improve my situation for well over a decade. I've been pushing harder than ever on this research since my son developed KP as a toddler that was much more severe than mine was at the same age. In these past 5 years I believe I\u2019ve discovered and developed a highly effective treatment to target the underlying barrier defects and inflammation/redness of KP. This was done through extensive testing and research, first by myself in a home-based lab, and then through partnering with a commercial R&D lab that helped me to formalize what I had developed.\u00a0\n\nThis post will attempt to summarize my proposal on the pathology of KP, treatment options, and why KP is such a misunderstood skin condition. At the time of posting, I believe that this KP theory is the most comprehensive research article ever compiled on Keratosis Pilaris.\u00a0\n\nIn the simplest terms, Keratosis Pilaris is a very common skin condition that begins with a single underlying root cause. That root cause is located in the epithelial skin barrier around the hair follicle where the barrier has cellular \u201cgaps\u201d (for lack of a better term) that allow moisture to escape and bacteria and allergens to pass into the skin, triggering an immune response. This barrier abnormality occurs well before keratin begins forming in the follicle.\u00a0\n\nThere are multiple KP symptoms that build on top of one another. From my research they follow this pattern:\n\n1. Skin cells fail to secrete lipids during maturation\n2. Skin barrier around the follicle is compromised\n3. Inflammation develops\n4. Sebaceous glands shrink and atrophy\n5. Hair follicles become brittle and curled\n6. Keratin accumulates in the follicle (creating the bumps)\n7. When inflammation recedes from the follicle it leaves behind post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\nNearly all treatments for KP are attempting to improve the texture of KP by chemically exfoliating the keratin buildup in the follicle, but since they do not adequately address all of the barrier issues or sebaceous gland shrinkage that develop prior to this symptom, the best results that you can expect to achieve are going to be texture improvements. Applying glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, urea, and/or retinol to a compromised skin barrier is not going to do much for improving redness and inflammation. In fact it may very well do the opposite.\u00a0\n\nWhile moisturizing the skin will help soften and reduce some dryness around the follicles, it\u2019s a losing battle if your skin is not producing enough sebum (skin oil) to moisturize and protect your follicles.\u00a0\n\nThis next part is going to be complicated and represents the bulk of my research on KP. What I cover here is delved into with much more depth in the article I linked at the beginning (and end) of this post.\u00a0\n\nI theorize that the barrier issues we see in KP are the direct result of deficient IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1) levels in skin tissue, combined with genetic mutations of Insulin growth factor receptors and the underlying cellular signaling pathways that regulate how skin cells mature and differentiate as they move through the layers of the skin.\u00a0\n\nConsider the following:\u00a0\n\n* Studies testing IGF-1 inhibition result in a disrupted epidermis that looks strikingly like the barrier disruption seen in KP: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/) & [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/)\n* IGF-1 and its effects on skin cells directly regulate skin cell maturation as the cells travel through the skin. Deficiency in IGF-1 and/or mutations in Insulin receptors would directly affect the skin cell as it differentiates and secretes lipids during the formation of the skin barrier around the SC-SG interface, which is exactly where we see barrier issues appearing in KP. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1430337/) & [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25660180/)\n* This study identified mutation of cellular pathways (triggered by IGF-1) resulting in the development of KP: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21062266/)\n* IGF-1 levels are lowest in children and steadily increase as you age into adulthood, correlating with how we see KP improve in some children as they age or \"grow out of their KP\": [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451965018300334](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451965018300334)\n* IGF-1 levels raise while we sleep, with sleep being crucial to hormone production. This correlates with people reporting that their KP appears less severe in the mornings upon waking. [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160412/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10160412/)\n* IGF-1 levels decrease and sebaceous glands are atrophied when undergoing Isotretinoin (Accutane) treatment. This correlates with the numerous reports we\u2019ve seen in [r/keratosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/) of people experiencing increased severity of KP after taking Accutane.\u00a0[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128787/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128787/)\n* IGF-1 levels are affected by pregnancy during increased estrogen production and additional hormonal factors. This correlates with reports of KP severity changes during and post pregnancy. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17492948/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17492948/)\n* PCOS and other conditions that affect insulin resistance also correlate with increased likelihood of KP development. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22374641/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22374641/)\n* Diets that contain high glycemic foods (rapidly digested carbohydrates) and milk proteins can effect insulin resistance, providing a potential link for some between diet and KP that so often is reported in [r/keratosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/keratosis/)\n* Keratosis pilaris can result from Dupilumab for the treatment of bronchial asthma. IGF-2 stimulates the secretion of the Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 by 40-70%, while Dupilumab has been shown to inhibit the Th2 pathway. This reinforces the assertion that mutations in this cellular pathway and its signaling are direct causes in the pathology of KP: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cia2.12172](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cia2.12172)\n* KP prevalence correlates with obesity, which in turn correlates with insulin resistance: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30043128/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30043128/)\n* IGF-1 is also responsible for the regulation of lipogenesis, which is thought to occur through IGF-1\u2019s effects on 5\u03b1-Reductase and the enzymatic process responsible for converting testosterone into DHT, which stimulates sebocyte proliferation. IGF-1 effective regulates sebum production in the skin. [https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/133/2/447/3035051](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/133/2/447/3035051)\n\nI could continue but at this point I think you are probably seeing the same patterns I see.\u00a0\n\nIGF-1 is also responsible for inhibiting inflammation via stimulation of IL-10 production which I believe is very crucial for people suffering from KPRF, a subtype of KP affecting the face with visible redness and flushing of the cheeks.\u00a0( [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277570/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277570/) )\n\nSo to summarize, IGF-1 and its related cellular pathways are connected directly or is one step removed from every symptom experienced by those with KP. Deficiency in IGF-1 and IR mutation also correlates with all of the events that are known to affect KP development and severity.\u00a0\n\nSo the big prompt is how do we improve IGF-1 bioavailability in skin tissue to prevent barrier issues from forming, thereby preventing KP symptoms?\n\nFor this, I believe I have a very compelling response.\u00a0\n\nHere is my arm with severe KP before and after applying this treatment for stimulating IGF-1 production in my skin through a topical lotion I developed:\n\n[My arm after 12 weeks of continued twice daily application of topical RK & Indirubin](https://preview.redd.it/hcka88bcwdme1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9107f018d87f5a5aef81cbd0d028ddfdebe54a5)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/how-we-can-improve-keratosis-pilaris-treatment-v0-3qo9em8anwle1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e9d591e2ac6952b607bbe4dae09b0b9677a6b9e)\n\nInitially in my research I was testing multiple compounds on my skin to determine their effectiveness on my KP. I finally settled on two specific compounds:\n\n**Raspberry Ketone:** The aromatic compound in red raspberries has been studied for topical application and has been shown to stimulate significant IGF-1 production in skin tissue through sensory neuron activation. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18321745/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18321745/)\n\n**Indirubin (Indigo Naturalis):** An anti inflammatory that reduces keratinocyte proliferation and cytokine production in the skin.\u00a0[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838180/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838180/)\n\nBy combining these ingredients into a jojoba oil base (which is a plant extracted oil that is\u00a0chemically similar to human sebum) I believe I have created the most effective skincare topical for regulating Keratosis Pilaris. This topical solution was also iterated on to balance pH and add the lowest effective concentration of lactic acid to help turn over skin cells without irritation, reducing pigmentation that has occurred due to post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\n\nI have written about this extensively on my website/blog, initially I tried to copy over the entire article but there is a 40,000 character limit and I know that linking your own site or blog post is against community guidelines, but if you find this theory interesting or want to see more evidence, feel free to DM me or head over to r/keratosis where I've shared more info. \n\nI really believe that we can approach KP skincare through a different lens.

  {"prompt": "[B&A] 14 months of hormonal, bacterial and fungal acne. Before, during, after and now.", "response": "Hello! \n\nI\u2019m making this post for people who are dealing with persistent issues with combination acne, whether that be fungal acne, hormonal, bacterial or all of the above at the same time. The reason why I am posting this is because I hope that my ongoing experience can help people treat their skin and figure out what kind of acne they are dealing with. \n\nThere was no simple \u2018cure-all\u2019 pill or wash or cream for my skin. It is a combination of dietary changes, antibiotics, lifestyle modifications and consistency. I couldn\u2019t do one without the other. \n\nMy current routine is at the bottom of the wall of text if you wish to skip. \n\n(I do not have any firm product recommendations, only active ingredient suggestions that helped. I\u2019m not an expert, I\u2019m still learning and I\u2019d like to encourage more knowledgeable minds to suggest any changes to my routine or products)\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nAbout the images:\n\nBefore my face started breaking out, I didn\u2019t have a skincare routine. I just washed my face with a cloth and water. I never had acne before. I was on birth control since I was 16 (2015) and stopped it January 2024 as well as smoking cigarettes then February 2024 is when I started getting acne, eczema on my hands, folliculitis on my scalp and body, dairy and bread intolerance. I\u2019m still seeing my doctor now if this is just an immune system thing. The timing of stopping my BC and all these things happening is definitely a coincidence, but before I get a proper response from my doctor and tests, I do not blame the BC entirely. \n\nFrom December to Feb, I started getting pimples. I didn\u2019t have closed comedones, my skin texture and color was even and hydrated. I didn\u2019t have any oily or dry spots. The pimples were large, deep and left red marks and holes in my cheeks.\n\nAfter February I started actually using products, mainly hyaluronic moisturizer and salicylic acid wash, however my skin was so sensitive that I could only use the SA once a week. My skin was a horrible combination of dry and oily as heck and it was getting worse. I saw a doctor and he said it was hormonal and it\u2019s because I got off the pill, suggested I should get back on it. I did not take his advice. I had a lot of redness, skin sensitivity, no closed comedones.\n\nJune - November was the worst. My self-esteem and confidence that I\u2019ve built up over the years was gone. My skin was red, inflamed, sensitive, no closed comedones, pores were clogged, deep pus pimples that kept coming back in the same spots. I was getting pimples in my eyebrows, scalp and body. I had bald spots on my scalp too from the pimples. Around this time I started going to skin clinics and following their product recommendations, doing their laser treatments, skin peels etc and it didn\u2019t help at all. It just cost me a lot of money. That was when I finally decided to see a different doctor and she listened to everything I said, checked me up and recommended I use Nizoral, no dairy, no yeast products, cut down on sugar, stop vaping and prescribed me Doxycycline. I did just that. \n\nNow, Ive finished my course of antibiotics, I noticed a huge difference. My hormonal cycle is settling down and I get a few hormonal pimples around my chin and jaw. My skin isn\u2019t what it used to be, I get deep pimples on my cheeks and small hard closed comedones and bumps on my face, but it\u2019s a lot better. I still get spots and pimples on my scalp but the Nizoral helps. Manually extracting the acne/pores/comedones helps a lot, but it doesn\u2019t stop them from coming back. My doctor recommended that I can try spironolactone or another course of doxycycline. I\u2019ll see how I go for now. \n\n~~~~~~~\n\n\nInfo: 26 cis F, half Asian, warm and humid climate, very sunny. \n\nSkin background: Normal amount of oil, never dry, hormonal acne spikes during cycle, actively dealing with the decreasing affects of bacterial and fungal acne, seen a doctor and I was on a course of doxycycline antibiotics (10mg daily) for 3 months and it made a huge difference, I use a ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral) once a month on my scalp and slap it a little around my face too. I also go to my local Taiwanese beauty salon once a month and for two hours I get my pores cleaned and acne and closed comedones extracted and a seaweed microneedling session. $180 AUD but so worth it. \n\nI spend an hour most late afternoons swimming at the beach then rinsing in my pool before a cold shower. I\u2019ve noticed an improvement in my skin since doing this for a couple months now. \n\nI don\u2019t consume any dairy products because it gives me breakouts (and sore tummy rip), bread and no sugar. This has helped a lot. \n\nI also wash my towels, bedsheets and pillows once a week, I wipe my headphones before I use them, only touch my face with clean hands, wash my hair every 4 days and drink a lot of water. \n\n~~~~~~~\n\n\nEvening Routine\ud83c\udf11\nProducts: \n\nWash: La Roche Posay Effaclar Micro Peeling Purifying Gel, Benzac AC wash 5%\n\nToner: Revolution Skin 2.5% Glycolic Acid Toner (if my face has active breakouts)\nSkin Physics Vitamin C Hydrating Mist Toner (if my face needs some more hydration) \n\nSerum: The Ordinary Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution (if my skin is inflamed or needs hydration or healing) \nThe Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution (if my skin has an active breakout) \n\nMoisturizer: Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Water Gel \n\nFace masks + toner pads: Mediheal madecassoside blemish pad, JM Solution Peach Vital Probio mask, rice face mask that I make.\n\nPimple patches: Skin republic salicylic acid and tea tree patches (if I have a big boy coming up)\n\nLip balm: Vaseline Lip Therapy Rosy Lips\n\nRoutine:\nwipe face with warm cloth\n\nuse warm cloth to gently massage La Roche Salicylic acid wash on my face until it start to tingle then wash off with warm water \n\nuse clean hands to gently massage Benzac wash onto face and then leave on for 30 seconds before washing off with cool water\n\n I\u2019ll just have a damp face and massage the moisturizer on then pat it with my hands, I\u2019ll also rub it over my lips too.\n\nIf my skin needs extra hydration, inflamed or healing, I\u2019ll spray the vitamin C toner on my face and then pat it in, using the Aloe serum after the toner is absorbed and then put moisturizer on.\n\nIf my skin is going through an active breakout I\u2019ll use the Glycolic toner and Salicylic serum then moisturize.

I find that this helps skin tone, hydration and healing.\n\nFor the blemish pads, I\u2019ll slap them on my washed face on my active breakout zones twice a week for 20 mins before following up with just moisturizer.

About 2-3 months ago I started using Cerave Blemish Control Cleanser and Facial Moisturizing Lotion, and everything was great till one moment a few weeks ago. I started having very bad red spots around the chin area, which made me to stop using any skincare just in case it was because of them.\n\nTo get some help, I asked my mother which has some knowledge about acne, and she bought some stuff to fix it. Mainly which is a custom lotion that I apply on my face (made out of: lincomycin, zinc oxide, Boric Acid, Sp. aethylicus, Aether (language barrier?)). As you see on the picture it's not that bad. Previously it was all red, and it definitely helped in a way, but I'm afraid it will just remain as it is right now since I had similar situations in the past.\n\nI've tried other solutions related to this chin/lip area rashness as well, like sls-free toothpaste, shaving properly with the guide from here, acne stickers (sort of). Some topics on the sub suggested this may be perioral dermatitis which may look similar to what I had before, but I don't want to self diagnose.\n\nIs there anything I can do?"},

I\u2019d appreciate  any advice on what I should do, thank you so much! "},
